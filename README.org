#+TITLE: LANTERN: an interpretable genotype-phenotype landscape model

*LANTERN is currently in alpha and the primary interface is subject to change*

* Documentation
  The official documentation with usage is available at: [[https://lantern-gpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][https://lantern-gpl.readthedocs.io]]
  
* System Requirements

** Hardware requirements
   ~lantern~ requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to
   support the in-memory operations. Runtime of model training on
   large-scale GPL datasets ($n \geq 10,000$) will benefit from GPU
   hardware but is not strictly necessary.

** Software requirements
   This package is supported for macOS and Linux. The package has been tested on the following systems:
   - macOS: Catalina (10.15)
   - Linux: Ubuntu 18.04

** Python Dependencies
   ~lantern~ depends primarily on ~pytorch~ and ~gpytorch~, as well as
   the components of the Python scientific stack:
   - ~pandas~
   - ~numpy~

* Installation guide

** Install from github
   ~LANTERN~ currently must be installed from this repository directly,
   either through pip:
   #+begin_src bash
     python -m pip install git+https://github.com/usnistgov/lantern.git
   #+end_src
   of by cloning this repository:
   #+begin_src bash
     git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/lantern.git
     cd lantern
     python setup.py install
   #+end_src
   In either case, it is recommended to install inside a [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html][virtual environment]].
