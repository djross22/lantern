#+TITLE: Analysis from manuscript "Interpretable modeling of genotype-phenotype landscapes with state-of-the-art predictive power"
#+AUTHOR: Peter D. Tonner (NIST)

* Setup
  
  To easily manage the dependencies to run this code, it is
  recommended to use [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/][conda]] with the provided ~environment.yml~ file:

  #+begin_src bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
  #+end_src
  
  This code is organized to run with a specific version of ~lantern~,
  and will not be compatible with future versions. To install the
  correct version run (preferably in a virtual environment):
  #+begin_src bash
    pip install git+git://github.com/usnistgov/lantern.git@dfe6d0190dd17330147abd139208a51f89794be0
  #+end_src

  Finally, one additional dependency (for training single-dimension
  global epistasis models), must be installed through pip:
  #+begin_src bash
    pip install dms_variants
  #+end_src
  
  Along with the ~lantern~ package, analysis for the manuscript
  requires additional packages to be installed:
  #+begin_src bash
    pip install lantern snakemake dms_variants plotnine dpath tqdm mlflow
  #+end_src
  
* Analysis
  A high-level view of available pipeline components is available
  through:
  #+begin_src bash
    snakemake -l
  #+end_src
